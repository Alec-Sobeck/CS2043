CS2043--Software-Engineering-I--Project
=======================================
This repository contains all the non-code artifacts and source code from my CS2043 ("Software Engineering I") Course Project. 
For this project, the following parts were required:<br>
1. A requirements document, based on the IEEE standard (although shorter for time reasons)<br>
2. A design document, based on IEEE standards (also shorter for time reasons)<br>
3. A test document, based on IEEE standards (a combination of the test plan, methodology, and results for time reasons)<br>
4. Source code for the final program, based on the documents prepared earlier.

The program itself was a reasonably simple one. It allowed the user to manage a list of billboards (each billboard had a title, location, and message). The list of billboards was stored in an XML file somewhere on the hard drive. The user could open previously saved XML files, save whatever billboards were currently loaded in memory to disk as an XML file, or edit the billboards using the GUI provided. A search feature was also added to help the user find a specific billboard.
